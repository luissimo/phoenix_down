          If you have an account you will get a confirmation. If you are not registered yet you will be asked
          to create an account. We need to get your League account information through your Elo-Boost i/o account to
          ensure safety and security. After we have your login information we will send your order to our
          League boosting manager. Depending on your order he will assign it to the best possible booster for this order.
          This means that he will look at availability, tier etc. to ensure a fast en efficient boost.

          We will change your order details and the order will continue as a budget boost: the amount you have paid will
          be calculated for your new rank. You will be boosted worth exactly that amount.
          If you prefer, you can also cancel your boost and re-order.

          Yes, the payment system will automatically convert to your local currency.
          I donâ€™t have a paypal account, can I use a different payment method?
          Unfortunately we are supporting only PayPal at the moment. We are working on adding multiple other
          payment methods, but this will take some time. Note that creating a PayPal account is free and you can
          deposit money with almost every payment method to your PayPal account.

          No, we do not account for jumps in division. This means that you neither pay more nor less when you jump a division.
