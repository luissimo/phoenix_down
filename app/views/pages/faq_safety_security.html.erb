          Safety and security are very important for us. That why we do everything in our power to keep your
          information safe. Boosters have no access to your information without using our application.
          Want to keep things in your own hands? Confirm your email with Riot so your League of Legends account is
          linked to it. This way you can always retrieve and change your private information if anything happens.
          You should always verify your accounts email address before giving access to ANYONE, that way your account
          is bound to you, forever.

        <p>When using your league boosting service, do boosters have access to my IP and RP?<p>

          At ELO-BOOST I/O we have rules concerning IP and RP expenditure. Boosters are not allowed to spend any
          points unless you give them permission to do so. Note however, that boosting can be done much faster when
          you allow your booster to buy his preferred runes ;)!

          There is always a small chance that this may happen, and no one can guarantee you 100% protection against it.
          If that will happen, we won't take responsibility for it. Elo boosting is like cheating on a test,
          in most cases its fine, and you will not get caught. In 2015 we had over 3000 succesfull League boosts,
          with 12 accounts receiving a ban. Of these bans more than half were due to the boosted person talking about
          being boosted rather than the boosting service itself.

          This is very unfortunate and you should contact our customer service so that we can punish the booster.
          At Elo-boost i/o we have strict rules about bad behavior. When a booster does not comply and gets reported and
          banned, we will make sure that this won’t happen to you or any other customer in the future.
